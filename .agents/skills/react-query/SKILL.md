description: Manages server state on the Next.js 16 frontend with TanStack Query v5 — structured array query keys, staleTime/gcTime tuning, useQuery/useMutation with onSuccess invalidateQueries by key prefix, and the server-state vs client-state boundary. Use when fetching or caching API data, wiring a query-key factory, invalidating after a POST/PATCH/DELETE, fixing stale UI after a mutation, or deciding what belongs in Query vs Zustand. Not for the tenant-switch procedure itself and what to purge on switch (see tenant-session-switch), persisted UI/client state (see zustand-state), or typing the API payload shapes (see drf-zod-contract).

# React Query (server state with TanStack Query v5)

## When to use
Any component that reads or writes data owned by the Django/DRF backend. Server
state is asynchronous, shared, and can go stale under you — that is Query's job.
Do **not** copy fetched rows into Zustand or `useState`; mirror-storing server
data is the top source of stale-UI bugs on this stack.

## Pattern
Three rules:

1. **Query keys are structured arrays from a factory**, never ad-hoc strings.
   A key is `['tenant', tenantId, 'invoices', 'list', filters]` — a stable,
   serializable description of *what* the data is, which under a per-tenant API
   includes *whose* it is. Prefix-matching then powers targeted invalidation.
2. **`staleTime` sets how long data is trusted; `gcTime` how long an unused
   cache lingers.** Pick per resource — not the defaults everywhere.
3. **After a mutation, invalidate by key prefix in `onSuccess`.** Don't manually
   patch the cache for the common case; let the refetch reconcile with the server.

Centralize keys in a factory, read with `useQuery`, write with `useMutation`,
then invalidate by prefix in `onSuccess`:

```ts
// features/invoices/keys.ts — tenant is part of the key, not just a header
export const invoiceKeys = {
  all: (t: string) => ['tenant', t, 'invoices'] as const,
  lists: (t: string) => [...invoiceKeys.all(t), 'list'] as const,
  list: (t: string, filters: InvoiceFilters) => [...invoiceKeys.lists(t), filters] as const,
  detail: (t: string, id: number) => [...invoiceKeys.all(t), 'detail', id] as const,
};

// Read (v5 single-object signature; no-data status is `isPending`)
const tenantId = useUI((s) => s.activeEntrepriseId);   // see `zustand-state`
const { data, isPending, isError } = useQuery({
  queryKey: invoiceKeys.list(tenantId, filters),
  queryFn: () => fetchInvoices(filters),   // returns a Zod-parsed payload
  enabled: !!tenantId,
  staleTime: 30_000,   // 30s: trust the list before refetching
  gcTime: 5 * 60_000,  // keep unused cache 5min for fast back-nav
});

// Write, then prefix-invalidate so every matching list/detail refetches
const qc = useQueryClient();
const { mutate } = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (body: InvoiceInput) => createInvoice(body),
  onSuccess: () => qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: invoiceKeys.all(tenantId) }),
});
// mutate(values) — call from the form's submit handler
```

## The server-state vs client-state boundary
| Belongs in React Query | Belongs in Zustand / local state |
| --- | --- |
| API rows, lists, details | Sidebar open, active tab, theme |
| Anything the server owns | Draft form input before submit |
| Derived-from-fetched values | Selected row id / UI filters* |

*Filters live in client state, then feed into the query key — the key is the
one place client and server state meet. Never duplicate the fetched rows.

## Switching tenants
A tenant switch changes which rows every key means, so it runs as an ordered
sequence — set the store, `cancelQueries`, remove the old tenant's entries,
resubscribe sockets, let observers refetch. The order is the safety property; see
`tenant-session-switch` for the full procedure and tenant-aware persistence.

## Adapt to your repo
Rename `invoices`/`invoiceKeys` and the accessor (`/api/invoices/`) per resource,
and keep one keys file per feature. Tune `staleTime` to how fast the data changes
(near-real-time dashboards → low or `0`; reference lists → minutes). Wrap the app
once in a `QueryClientProvider` in a client boundary under the App Router. Make
`queryFn` return the Zod-validated shape (see `drf-zod-contract`).

## Gotchas
- v5 renamed `isLoading`→`isPending` for the no-data state, `cacheTime`→`gcTime`,
  and takes a **single object** — positional `useQuery(key, fn)` no longer exists.
- `invalidateQueries` prefix-matches, so `{ queryKey: ['invoices'] }` catches
  every list and detail; scoping too narrowly leaves stale sibling views.
- `staleTime: 0` (the default) refetches on every mount/focus — deliberate, but
  chatty for stable data. Set it up rather than leaving it implicit.
- Reading `data` off a mirrored Zustand copy defeats invalidation — the refetch
  updates the cache, not your snapshot. Read straight from `useQuery`.
- Cookie-JWT auth means the browser sends the HttpOnly cookie automatically, but
  `credentials: 'include'` alone only covers reads — mutating `mutationFn` calls also
  need the `X-CSRFToken` header. Go through the shared client (see `nextjs-module`)
  rather than hand-rolling `fetch` in a `queryFn`.
- **Security-critical: the tenant belongs IN the query key, not only in the request
  header.** Two tenants otherwise share the cache entry `['invoices','list',filters]`,
  and after a tenant switch the cache happily serves the previous tenant's rows — a
  cross-tenant leak your backend never sees. Scope every key under
  `['tenant', tenantId, ...]` so two tenants can never collide in one entry (the
  purge on switch is `tenant-session-switch`'s job). Client-side isolation is
  defence-in-depth, not the boundary — the server still enforces it (see
  `multi-tenancy`, `rbac-permissions`).
